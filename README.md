# C-Even-or-Odd-number-indicator
This code takes the input from the user and determines whether it's even or odd by making modulus of the number if it's divided by 2
with remainder of an integer (no fraction) and in the first case if that happened then it is an even number
in the second case if it's  not then the number is odd.
